# animatrixr

The goal of animatrixr is to support my blog post on animating matrix transformations.

## Installation

You can install the released version of animatrixr from my github page:

``` r
devtools::install_github("brshallo/animatrixr")
```

## Warning

This is a toy package for use in the aforementioned blog. I have no plans for actively mantaining it and am not suggesting others use it.
